# Welcome to [Cpp-hacktoberfest25] - Hacktoberfest 2025 🎉

Thank you for checking out this repository! We're excited to have you contribute to Hacktoberfest 2025. Before you get started, please take a moment to read the following rules and guidelines to ensure a smooth contribution process.

## How to Contribute

1. **Hacktoberfest Dates:**
   - Your Pull/Merge Requests (PR/MRs) must be created between **October 1 and October 31** (in any time zone).
   - Contributions made to this repository must follow Hacktoberfest rules and be submitted to public, unarchived repositories.

2. **Quality Over Quantity:**
   - **No Spam:** Submitting spammy PR/MRs will disqualify you. Keep your contributions meaningful, and avoid low-quality fixes like minor grammar updates unless they add real value.
   - PR/MRs should not be marked with labels containing the word **“spam”** or **“invalid.”** However, contributions labeled with **“hacktoberfest-accepted”** will be considered valid, even if they are not merged immediately.

3. **Repository Participation:**
   - This repository is participating in Hacktoberfest, so feel free to contribute!
   - Ensure that your PR/MR is either merged, has an overall approving review, or receives the **“hacktoberfest-accepted”** label to count toward your Hacktoberfest progress.

4. **Review Period:**
   - Once your PR/MR is created and passing checks, it will go through a **seven-day review period**. Make sure your submission remains compliant throughout this time.
   - Even if Hacktoberfest ends on October 31, PR/MRs still in the seven-day review period may continue into November.

5. **Valid Contributions:**
   - Ensure that your contribution adds real value to the project. Bug fixes, new features, and documentation improvements are welcome!
